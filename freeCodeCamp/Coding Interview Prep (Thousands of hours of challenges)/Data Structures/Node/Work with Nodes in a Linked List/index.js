// Data Structures: Work with Nodes in a Linked List
// Another common data structure you 'll run into in computer science is the linked list. A linked list is a linear collection of data elements, called '
// nodes ', each of which points to the next. Each node in a linked list contains two key pieces of information: the element itself, and a reference to the next node.

// Imagine that you are in a conga line.You have your hands on the next person in the line, and the person behind you has their hands on you.
// You can see the person straight ahead of you, but they are blocking the view of the other people ahead in line.A node is just like a person in a conga line:
//     they know who they are and they can only see the next person in line, but they are not aware of the other people ahead or behind them.

// In our code editor, we 've created two nodes, Kitten and Puppy, and we've manually connected the Kitten node to the Puppy node.

// Create a Cat and Dog node and manually add them to the line.

// Your Puppy node should have a reference to a Cat node.

// Your Cat node should have a reference to a Dog node.

var Node = function(element) {
    this.element = element;
    this.next = null;
};
var Kitten = new Node('Kitten');
var Puppy = new Node('Puppy');

var Cat = new Node('Cat');
var Dog = new Node('Dog');

Puppy.next = Cat;
Cat.next = Dog;

Kitten.next = Puppy;
