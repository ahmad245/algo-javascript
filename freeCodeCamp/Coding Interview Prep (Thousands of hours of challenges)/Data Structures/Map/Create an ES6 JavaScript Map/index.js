// ion of JavaScript provides us with a built - in Map object which provides much of the functionality we wrote by hand in the last challenge.
// This Map object, although similar to regular JavaScript objects, provides some useful functionality that normal objects lack.
// For example, an ES6 Map tracks the insertion order of items that are added to it.Here is a more complete overview of its methods:
//     .has(key) returns true or false based on the presence of a key.get(key) returns the value associated with a key.set(key, value) sets a new key,
//     value pair.delete(key) removes a key, value pair.clear() removes all key,
//     value pairs.entries() returns an array of all the keys in insertion order.values() returns an array of all the values in insertion order

// Define a JavaScript Map object and assign to it a variable called myMap.Add the key, value pair freeCodeCamp, Awesome!to it.

// The myMap object should exist.

// myMap should contain the key value pair freeCodeCamp, Awesome!.

let map = new Map();
map.set('freeCodeCamp', 'Awesome');
