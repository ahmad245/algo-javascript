//In Thumbtack, users are able to rate Pros based on their experience working with them. 
//Each rating is an integer ranging from 1 to 5, and all ratings are averaged to produce a single number rating for any given Pro. 
//Those Pros who have a rating lower than a specified threshold are manually reviewed by Thumbtack staff to ensure high quality of service.

//You're given a list of ratings for some Pros. Find out which Pros should be manually reviewed.

// Example

// For threshold = 3.5 and

// ratings = [[3, 4], [3, 3, 3, 4], [4]] the output should be ratingThreshold(threshold, ratings) = [1].

// Assume that we have 3 Pros that have received the following ratings: [3, 4], [3, 3, 3, 4] and [4]. 
//Then And if threshold = 3.5 the answer is ratingThreshold(threshold, ratings) = [1]. 
//The first Pro's rating is 3.5, the second one's is 3.25, and the last one's is 4, 
//so only the second Pro should be reviewed manually (the output is their 0-based index).

// Hints
