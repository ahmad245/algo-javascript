## Number Of Possible Binary Tree Topologies

#### Problem Statement


Write a function that takes in a non-negative integer n and that returns the number of possible Binary Tree topologies that can be created with exactly n nodes. A
Binary Tree topology is dened as any Binary Tree conguration, irrespective of node values. For instance, there exist only two Binary Tree topologies when n is
equal to 2: a root node with a left node, and a root node with a right node. Node that when n is equal to 0, there is one topology that can be created: the None
(null) node.

Sample input: 3

Sample output: 5



#### Explanation

We can use a Stack here


#### Solution
