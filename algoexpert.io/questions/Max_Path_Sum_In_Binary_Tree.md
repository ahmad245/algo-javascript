## Max Path Sum In Binary Tree

#### Problem Statement

Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns its max path sum. A path is a collection of connected nodes where no node is connected to more than two
other nodes; a path sum is the sum of the values of the nodes in a particular path. Each Binary Tree node has a value stored in a property called "value" and two
children nodes stored in properties called "left" and "right," respectively. Children nodes can either be Binary Tree nodes themselves or the None (null) value.
