## Knapsack Problem

#### Problem Statement

You are given an array of arrays. Each subarray in this array holds two integer values and
represents an item; the rst integer is the item's value, and the second integer is the item's
weight. You are also given an integer representing the maximum capacity of a knapsack
that you have. Your goal is to t items in your knapsack, all the while maximizing their
combined value. Note that the sum of the weights of the items that you pick cannot
exceed the knapsack's capacity. Write a function that returns the maximized combined
value of the items that you should pick, as well as an array of the indices of each item
picked. Assume that there will only be one combination of items that maximizes the total
value in the knapsack.

`Sample input: [[1, 2], [4, 3], [5, 6], [6, 7]], 10
Sample output: [10, [1, 3]]`
