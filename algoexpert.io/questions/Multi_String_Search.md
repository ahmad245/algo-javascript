## Multi String Search

#### Problem Statement


Write a function that takes in a "big" string and an array of"small" strings, all of which are smaller in length than the big string. The function should return an array
of booleans, where each boolean represents whether or not the small string at that index in the array of small strings is contained in the big string. Note that you
cannot use language-built-in string-matching methods.

Sample input:"this is a big string", ["this","yo","is","a","bigger","string","kappa"]

Sample output: [True, False, True, True, False, True, False]
