## Zigzag Traverse

#### Problem Statement


Write a function that takes in a two-dimensional array and returns a one-dimensional array of all the array's elements in zigzag order. Zigzag order starts at the
top left corner of the two-dimensional array, goes down by one element, and proceeds in a zigzag pattern all the way to the bottom right corner.


`Sample input:
[
[1, 3, 4, 10],
[2, 5, 9, 11],
[6, 8, 12, 15],
[7, 13, 14, 16],
]
Sample output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]`
