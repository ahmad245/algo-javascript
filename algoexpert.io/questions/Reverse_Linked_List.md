## Reverse Linked List

#### Problem Statement


Write a function that takes in the head of a Singly Linked List (assume that the list has at least 1 node; in other words, the head will
never be a null value). The function should reverse the list and return its new head. Note that every node in the Singly Linked List
has a "value" property storing its value as well as a "next" property pointing to the next node in the list or None (null) if it is the tail
of the list.

`Sample input: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 (the head node with value 0)
`
`Sample output: 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0 (the new head node with value 5)`
