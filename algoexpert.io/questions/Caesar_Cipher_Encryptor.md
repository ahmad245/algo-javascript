## Caesar Cipher Encryptor

#### Problem Statement


Given a non-empty string of lowercase letters and a non-negative integer value representing a key, write a function that returns a new string obtained by shifting
every letter in the input string by k positions in the alphabet, where k is the key. Note that letters should "wrap" around the alphabet; in other words, the letter "z"
shifted by 1 returns the letter "a".

Sample input:"xyz", 2
Sample output:"zab"
