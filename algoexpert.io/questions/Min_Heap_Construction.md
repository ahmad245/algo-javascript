## Min Heap Construction

#### Problem Statement


Implement a Min Heap class. The class should support insertion, removal (of the minimum / root value), peeking (of the minimum / root value), as well as sifting a
value up and down the heap and building the heap from an input array. The heap should be represented in the form of an array.


Sample input: [48, 12, 24, 7, 8, -5, 24, 391, 24, 56, 2, 6, 8, 41]
-> buildHeap(array)
-> insert(76)
-> remove()
-> remove()
-> insert(87)


Sample output:
-> [-5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 8, 24, 391, 24, 56, 12, 24, 48, 41]
-> [-5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 8, 24, 391, 24, 56, 12, 24, 48, 41, 76]
-> [2, 7, 6, 24, 8, 8, 24, 391, 76, 56, 12, 24, 48, 41]
-> [6, 7, 8, 24, 8, 24, 24, 391, 76, 56, 12, 41, 48]
-> [6, 7, 8, 24, 8, 24, 24, 391, 76, 56, 12, 41, 48, 87]



#### Explanation

We can use a Stack here
