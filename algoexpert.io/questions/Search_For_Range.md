## Search For Range

#### Problem Statement

Search For Range
Write a function that takes in a sorted array of integers as well as a target integer. The function should use a variation of the Binary
Search algorithm to nd a range of indices in between which the target number is contained in the array and should return this range in
the form of an array. The rst number in the output array should represent the rst index at which the target number is located while the
second number should represent the last index at which the target number is located. The function should return [-1, -1] if the number is
not contained in the array.

Sample input: [0, 1, 21, 33, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 45, 61, 71, 73], 45
Sample output: [4, 9]
